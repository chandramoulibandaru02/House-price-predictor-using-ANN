# Machine Learning Regression Model

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow using a regression model. The process includes data preprocessing, handling missing values, feature scaling, model training using a neural network, and evaluating performance using R² score.

### 🔍 Key Features:
- Data loading and merging using Pandas
- Handling missing values (median imputation)
- Random sampling of training data
- Neural Network model with:
  - ReLU activations
  - Linear output
  - Adam optimizer with Mean Squared Error loss
- Evaluation using R² score and training visualization
- Predicting on new inputs after model training

### 📁 Tech Stack:
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib (for training visualization)

---

🚀 **Usage:**
Train the model using the provided dataset, evaluate the performance, and make predictions on new data samples with 8 input features.
